Simple Programming Language Compiler using Lex and Yacc
Project Overview
This project is part of the CMP(N)403 Languages and Compilers course at Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering. The objective is to design and implement a simple programming language using Lex and Yacc compiler generating packages.

Features
The compiler supports the following features:

Variable and Constant Declarations
Mathematical and Logical Expressions
Assignment Statements
Control Flow Constructs: If-then-else, while loops, repeat-until loops, for loops, switch statements
Block Structure: Nested scopes with variable declarations
Functions
Additionally, the compiler includes:

Symbol Table: An extensible format for storing variable information
Lexical Analyzer: Implemented using Lex
Parser: Implemented using Yacc with action rules to produce output quadruples
Syntax Error Handling
Semantic Analyzer: Checks for variable declaration conflicts, type mismatches, uninitialized variables, and unused variables
Project Phases
Phase I
Delivery of lexer and parser (Lex and Yacc files)
Phase II
Extension of implementations to include:
Symbol table design
Action rules for output quadruples
Proper syntax error handler
Simple semantic analyzer
Deliverables
Source Code: Complete implementation of the compiler

C Programming Language
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Compile the lexer and parser:
bash
Copy code
make
Run the compiler:
bash
Copy code
./compiler your-source-code-file
Quadruples
The compiler generates quadruples for various operations. Below is a short description of each:

JMP L: Unconditional jump to label L
NEG V1, V2: V2 = -V1
Evaluation Criteria
Correctness of the generated quadruples
Handling of syntax and semantic errors
Teamwork and quality of documentation
Optional Features (Bonus)
Addition of type conversion quadruples
Implementation of a simple GUI
Additional semantic checks
